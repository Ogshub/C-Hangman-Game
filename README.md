# C++ Hangman Game
A simple Hangman game implemented in C++ to practice basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

## About
This project is a Hangman game created as part of a personal practice to enhance C++ programming skills. The game involves guessing a randomly selected word by entering letters, with a limited number of attempts. It features user input validation, display of attempts in the form of plus signs (`+`), and updating of hidden words based on correct guesses.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Display of hidden word with underscores (`_`) for unguessed letters.
- Tracks and displays remaining attempts as plus signs (`+++++`).
- User input validation to ensure only alphabetic characters are entered.
- Keeps track of guessed letters and alerts the user if they repeat a guess.
- Win or lose condition based on successful word guessing or running out of attempts.
